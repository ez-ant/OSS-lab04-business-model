Business Model: Create a mobile operating system for phones. The company makes profit by selling applications in app store, provides data backup/recovery service and advertisement.

I choose Apache license because I would like to attract other people to choose using this operating system. Giving them access to modify the system for commerical use would attract software developers to develop softwares and therefore make the community thrive. The company would mostly make profit by providing paid services, therefore it's important to attract users to choose this operating system.
